# Call Automation - Quick Start Sample

This sample application shows how the Azure Communication Services  - Call Automation SDK can be used to build IVR related solutions. 
It makes an outbound call to a phone number, performs DTMF recognition, plays a different audio message based on the key pressed by the callee and hangs-up the call. 
This sample application configured for accepting tone 1 (tone1), 2 (tone2) , If the callee pressed any other key than expected, the call will be disconnected.
This sample application is also capable of making multiple concurrent outbound calls. The application is a web-based application built on .Net7 framework.

## Prerequisites

- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. For details, see [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Create an Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Create an Azure Communication Resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource). You will need to record your resource **connection string** for this sample.
- Get a phone number for your new Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Get a phone number](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number?tabs=windows&pivots=programming-language-csharp)
- Create and host a Azure Dev Tunnel. Instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started)
- [.NET7 Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) (Make sure to install version that corresponds with your visual studio instance, 32 vs 64 bit)

## Before running the sample for the first time

1. Open an instance of PowerShell, Windows Terminal, Command Prompt or equivalent and navigate to the directory that you would like to clone the sample to.
2. git clone `https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Communication-Services-dotnet-quickstarts.git`.
3. Navigate to `CallAutomation_OutboundCalling` folder and open `CallAutomation_OutboundCalling.sln` file.

### Setup and host your Azure DevTunnel

[Azure DevTunnels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/overview) is an Azure service that enables you to share local web services hosted on the internet. Use the commands below to connect your local development environment to the public internet. This creates a tunnel with a persistent endpoint URL and which allows anonymous access. We will then use this endpoint to notify your application of calling events from the ACS Call Automation service.

```bash
devtunnel create --allow-anonymous
devtunnel port create -p 8080
devtunnel host
```
### Configuring application

Open the Program.cs file to configure the following settings

1. `acsConnectionString`: Azure Communication Service resource's connection string.
2. `acsPhonenumber`: Phone number associated with the Azure Communication Service resource. For e.g. "+1425XXXAAAA"
3. `targetPhonenumber`: Target phone number to add in the call. For e.g. "+1425XXXAAAA"
4. `callbackUriHost`: Base url of the app. (For local development replace the dev tunnel url)

### Run app locally

1. Run the `CallAutomation_OutboundCalling` project with `dotnet run`
2. Open `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html` or your dev tunnel url in browser
3. To initiate the call, from the swagger ui execute the `/outboundCall` endpoint or make a Http post request to `<callbackUriHost>/outboundCall`
